# Prokudin-Gorskii-Color-Image-Reconstruction
Sergey Prokudin-Gorskii captured early color photographs by taking three separate exposures through blue, green, and red filters. The resulting scans are stacked vertically in a single grayscale image. This project reconstructs a modern color photo by splitting, aligning, and enhancing those three exposures.
